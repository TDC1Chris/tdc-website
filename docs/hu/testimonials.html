       "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5 Stars – Ramen Cravings Crushed, Service Level: Chris! 🍜
       <br/>
       Let’s get straight to the star of this visit — Chris, our server, who deserves an entire Michelin star for service alone! The man greeted us with a huge smile, was warm, friendly, and so on point, I felt like royalty without even lifting a finger.
       <br/>
       Water? Already refilled.
       <br/>
       To-go boxes? Magically appeared.
       <br/>
       Dessert? He asked before I could even peek at the menu.
       <br/>
       Chris is the definition of proactive service with impeccable timing and grace. Honestly, if more servers had his level of attention and heart, the world would be a better-fed, happier place. Kudos to you, Chris — you didn’t just satisfy my tonkotsu ramen and edamame, you elevated the whole dining experience.
       <br/>
       Edamame? As a must as always! A great way to start.
       <br/>
       And the ramen? Flavorful, rich, and served in a glorious bowl big enough to share (unless you’re like me and “accidentally” finish it solo). Pro tip: add the extra egg — always.
       <br/>
       I’ll definitely be back for the ramen. 😋🤤
       <br/>
       Okay fine, for Chris too — ohhh I mean… the ramen. Wink.😉
       <br/>
       Highly recommend. 10/10. Slurps guaranteed."
