## Deployment

GitHub Pages is configured to serve the contents of `docs/`. The
`.nojekyll` file inside that folder disables GitHub's default Jekyll
processing so the HTML is served exactly as committed.

If you maintain the site using Jekyll, place your Jekyll project in a
`jekyll-site/` directory and build it into `docs/`:

```bash
cd jekyll-site
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll build -d ../docs
```

These steps copy the generated `_site` output into `docs/`, which GitHub
Pages then publishes. You can automate this with a GitHub Action that runs
the above commands whenever changes are pushed.

## Development & Continuous Integration

Run `npm install` to install the Node.js tooling. Two npm scripts are provided:

```bash
npm run build    # compile and minify assets into docs/assets/
npm run lint     # check HTML and validate links
```

A GitHub Action defined at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs these commands on
every pull request to ensure the site builds and passes the linters.

Install the Python packages used by `auto_translate_site.py`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Tests

Unit tests are written with [pytest](https://pytest.org). After installing
`pytest`, run the test suite from the repository root:

```bash
pytest
```

## Notes

- Use the `assets/` folder for all CSS, JS, and media files.
- To add a favicon, place `favicon.ico` in `/docs/` and add the appropriate `<link rel="icon" ...>` tag to each HTML `<head>`.
- All HTML pages are hand-coded for performance and maintainability.
- For language support, copy and translate `index.html` to `/[lang]/index.html` for each supported NATO language.

## Testing

Install `pytest` and run the test suite from the repository root:

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest
```
